# Sample repo for webpack error
Dynamic imports 'interfere' with each other (leading to errors) when loading multiple webpack bundles.


# How to reproduce
```
git clone https://github.com/roblan/webpack-dynamic-imports-error.git
cd webpack-dynamic-imports-error
npm install
npm start
```
go to http://localhost:8080
